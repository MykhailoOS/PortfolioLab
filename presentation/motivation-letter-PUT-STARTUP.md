Dear PUT START-UP Competition Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in participating in the third edition of the PUT START-UP competition. As a student of Automatic Control and Robotics at Poznan University of Technology, I am excited to present my project, **Portfolio Maker Pro**, which addresses a real problem I have experienced firsthand.

## Why This Competition?

When I started looking for internships and job opportunities, I realized something important: almost every successful candidate had a professional online portfolio. However, creating one seemed impossible without coding skills. I tried expensive website builders, but they were too complex and not designed for students like me. This frustration became my inspiration.

The PUT START-UP competition is the perfect opportunity to transform this idea into reality. I am not just seeking financial support – I am looking for mentorship, validation, and the chance to connect with people who understand the startup journey. Representing Poznan University of Technology at the EUNICE Imagine Innovation Cup 2026 would be an honor and a tremendous learning experience.

## What Makes Portfolio Maker Pro Different?

My project is simple: **anyone should be able to create a stunning portfolio in 15 minutes, without writing a single line of code.**

Portfolio Maker Pro combines:

- **Visual drag-and-drop editing** – no technical knowledge required
- **3D effects and modern design** – portfolios that stand out
- **Real-time preview** – see changes instantly
- **Cloud-based storage** – work from anywhere, never lose progress
- **Multilingual support** – accessible to students worldwide

But what truly sets this project apart is that **I am building it for people like me** – students who need to showcase their skills but don't have time or money for complex solutions.

## Why I Am Ready

Over the past months, I have:

- Built a fully functional prototype using React, TypeScript, and modern web technologies
- Integrated 3D rendering capabilities (Three.js) that make portfolios visually impressive
- Developed an intuitive user interface tested with fellow students
- Created a scalable cloud-based architecture ready for growth

I am not afraid of challenges. Coming from Automatic Control and Robotics, I learned to solve complex problems systematically. Now I am applying this engineering mindset to entrepreneurship.

## My Vision

If selected for this competition, I will:

1. **Refine the product** based on real user feedback from the PUT community
2. **Develop a sustainable business model** that keeps the platform affordable for students
3. **Build partnerships** with universities to help students succeed in their careers
4. **Scale the platform** to serve thousands of users across Europe

This is not just a project for a competition – this is the beginning of something bigger. I want to create a tool that empowers the next generation of professionals, starting right here at Poznan University of Technology.

## My Commitment

I am fully committed to this journey. I am ready to:

- Dedicate my time and energy to developing this startup
- Learn from mentors and industry experts
- Present confidently in front of investors and judges
- Iterate quickly based on feedback
- Build a product that makes our university proud

The PUT START-UP competition offers exactly what I need: structured support, expert mentorship, and a community of like-minded innovators. I am not asking for an easy path – I am asking for an opportunity to prove that with the right guidance, student ideas can become real solutions.

## Why This Matters

Every day, talented students struggle to present themselves professionally online. They have skills, projects, and potential – but no platform to showcase them effectively. Portfolio Maker Pro solves this problem. It levels the playing field and gives everyone the tools to succeed.

This is personal for me. I know how it feels to be stuck between having great ideas and not knowing how to present them. That's why I built this platform. And that's why I am confident it will help thousands of others.

**I am ready to compete. I am ready to learn. I am ready to build something meaningful.**

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to presenting Portfolio Maker Pro and showing you why this project deserves your support.

With determination and respect,

**Michael Pashchenko**
