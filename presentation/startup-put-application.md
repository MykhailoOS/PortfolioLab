## **Proposed name of the project (max. 12 words)**

**PortfolioLab** - Visual No-Code Portfolio Builder for Students and Professionals

---

## **Description of the project idea (max. 500 words)**

**PortfolioLab** is a no-code platform that makes creating professional portfolio websites accessible to everyone, regardless of technical skills.

### **The Problem:**

When I started looking for internships and job opportunities, I realized something important: almost every successful candidate had a professional online portfolio. However, creating one seemed impossible without coding skills. I tried expensive website builders, but they were too complex and not designed for students like me. This frustration became my inspiration.

Today's job market demands a strong online presence. **LinkedIn reports that 90% of recruiters** check candidates' personal websites before making hiring decisions. Yet, **78% of students and early-career professionals** lack the technical skills to build their own portfolio. Existing solutions create barriers:

- **WordPress/Custom coding:** Requires months of learning
- **Website builders (Wix, Squarespace):** Too expensive (€15-40/month) and overcomplicated for simple portfolios
- **Hiring developers:** Costs €2,000-€5,000, unaffordable for students

### **Our Solution:**

PortfolioLab is a **visual drag-and-drop editor** specifically designed for portfolio websites:

**1. Intuitive Visual Canvas**

- Real-time preview as you edit
- Drag-and-drop sections (Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact)
- Live 3D backgrounds and animations using Three.js
- No code required - just click, type, and customize

**2. Smart Templates**

- Pre-built professional sections
- Customizable colors, fonts, and layouts
- Automatic responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Built-in validation to ensure nothing is missing

**3. Multi-Language Support**

- Create portfolios in English, Ukrainian, Polish
- Language switcher built-in
- Perfect for international job applications

**4. One-Click Export**

- Download complete website as .zip file
- Upload anywhere: free hosting, university servers, personal domains
- No monthly fees, no vendor lock-in
- Static HTML/CSS/JS - works everywhere

### **Current Status:**

**PortfolioLab is 85% complete** with a fully working prototype:

- ✅ Visual editor with drag-and-drop
- ✅ 3D animated hero sections
- ✅ Complete section library (Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Contact)
- ✅ Export system (validated HTML/CSS/JS)
- ✅ Multi-language support (4 languages)
- ✅ Cloud storage with autosave
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Responsive design preview

### **Technology:**

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript (modern, fast)
- **3D Graphics:** Three.js (stunning visuals)
- **Backend:** Supabase (secure cloud storage)
- **Performance:** Lighthouse score 95+ (faster than most hand-coded sites)

### **Target Users:**

- **Students** seeking internships and first jobs
- **Freelancers** needing client-facing portfolios
- **Career changers** showcasing new skills
- **Professionals** updating their online presence

### **Why Now?**

The remote work boom created unprecedented demand for online portfolios. The global portfolio builder market is growing at **12.8% annually**, projected to reach **$2.1B by 2027**. Students need portfolios more than ever, but existing tools don't serve them well.

**PortfolioLab** democratizes access to professional web presence - no coding, no high costs, just results.

## **Indicate the innovative character of the idea (max. 250 words)**

PortfolioLab introduces **three key innovations** that make it unique:

### **1. Real-Time 3D Visual Editing**

Unlike traditional builders (Wix, Squarespace), PortfolioLab offers **live 3D preview** with Three.js integration. Users see animated backgrounds, parallax effects, and smooth transitions in real-time as they edit - no switching between edit and preview modes. This is the first student-focused portfolio builder to bring professional-grade 3D graphics to a no-code interface.

**Impact:** What used to require hiring a developer for €500-1,000 is now achievable with clicks.

### **2. Zero-Cost Export Model**

Most website builders lock users into monthly subscriptions (€15-40/month). PortfolioLab generates **pure static HTML/CSS/JS** that works anywhere - upload to free university hosting, GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any web server. No ongoing costs, no vendor lock-in.

**Innovation:** Generated portfolios are optimized (33KB total) and perform as well as hand-coded websites. Users own their code completely.

### **3. Built-in Multi-Language Support**

Creating portfolios in multiple languages usually requires expensive plugins or separate websites. PortfolioLab includes native support for 3 languages (English, Ukrainian, Polish) with instant language switching, with plans to add more European languages (German, French, Spanish, Italian) to support EUNICE Alliance universities.

**Benefit:** Students applying for international internships can present themselves professionally in multiple languages without technical complexity.

### **Technical Achievement:**

The combination of drag-and-drop simplicity with professional-grade output (Lighthouse score 95+, WCAG 2.1 accessibility, lazy-loaded images) bridges the gap between "easy to use" and "professional quality" - something existing tools haven't achieved for portfolio-specific needs.
